avr-toolchain
=============

Contains snapshots and tools for building AVR projects against the new microcontrollers from Microchip.  You can read about their [c-compilers here](http://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/avr-and-arm-toolchains-(c-compilers))

This repository contains a Makefile template as well, which you'll need to modify the path variables at the top so it can find the pack files, new AVR toolchain, etc.
